# Customer-Segmentation


- The Customer Segmentation model utilizes clustering algorithms to divide a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and interactions.
- Through data preparation, feature selection, and segmentation techniques like K-means or hierarchical clustering, the model identifies meaningful customer segments.
- Insights gained from this segmentation aid in targeted marketing, personalized product recommendations, and tailored customer experiences, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
